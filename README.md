Jquery Event Planner

In this JS/Jquery project I am creating a daily planner that will provide me with an updated planner based on the day and time. 

My planner provides a color coated schedule for each hour of the day. 

When an event/hour has passed, that hourly block of the planner will be greyed out. 

When it's the current time of the event/hour, that hourly block will be red indicating that the hour is in progress.

For future blocks of time, each block will be color coded green.

If I want to save something in my planner for an hourly block, I am able to input it in the text area and then click the lock button on the right to store/save that information.

If time has passed, I can delete any lines in the text area and then click the lock button again to save the removal.
